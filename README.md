# stock-market-trend-predictor

This repository contains a stock market trend predictor created to train multiple machine learning models on historical Apple, Inc. (AAPL) stock trends and accurately predict future trends in the the market. 

The R program looks to first recreate a predictive support vector model created by Bin Weng at Auburn University, then improve the model's accuracy by alternatively implementing the model with AdaBoost trees. 

This program was able to increase model accuracy and lower the misclassification rate of historical stock market trends, but it increased test error. Future improvements to the model can include splitting the training and testing data differently or using different weighting schemes. 

The .pdf file includes a complete analysis of the R program. AAPL.csv is the historical Apple, Inc. data needed to accurately run the program.
